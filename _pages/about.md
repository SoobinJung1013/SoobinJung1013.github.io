love reading books. Of course, studying. 

Also love to write and i like observing others as mush as others. 
I think i enjoy difficult situations. Maybe that's because i know that the extreme conditions that can test my abilities will improve me. It's hard, but it's harder for me to stay the same without growing up. No matter what the reason is, i will keep moving forward. And maybe that's my destiny.
