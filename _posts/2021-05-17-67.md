Summary: Cloud Build: builds fail trying to fetch git repositories from GitHub

Description: Mitigation work is currently underway by our engineering team.

We do not have an ETA for mitigation at this point.

We will provide more information by Sunday, 2021-05-16 10:48 US/Pacific.

Diagnosis: The problem is limited to GitHub only. The product team is now cooperating with GitHub to troubleshoot the issue on their side.

Workaround: Authenticating the repository using GitHub (Legacy) is reported to throw a warning but still complete the builds.
