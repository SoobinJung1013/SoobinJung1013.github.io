### [DinD(docker in docker)와 DooD(docker out of docker)](https://aidanbae.github.io/code/docker/dinddood/)

# [Role of docker-in-docker (dind) service in gitlab ci](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47280922/role-of-docker-in-docker-dind-service-in-gitlab-ci)

- [`docker:latest`](https://github.com/docker-library/docker/blob/157869f94ea90e2acb4d0f77045d99079ead821c/18.02/Dockerfile) contains everything necessary to connect to a docker daemon, i.e., to run `docker build`, `docker run` and such. It also contains the docker daemon but it's not started as its entrypoint.
- [`docker:dind`](https://github.com/docker-library/docker/blob/157869f94ea90e2acb4d0f77045d99079ead821c/18.02/dind/Dockerfile) builds on `docker:latest` and starts a docker daemon as its entrypoint.

# [docker.errors.DockerException: Error while fetching server API version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64952238/docker-errors-dockerexception-error-while-fetching-server-api-version)

에러 뷔페도 아니고 종류별로 다 뜨네 ... 

Are you sure docker is running on your system? You can get that error when compose is not able to connect to docker via docker socket (if any other way for connection is not defined).

If you are running on linux, usually you can run "systemctl status docker" to check if docker daemon is running and "systemctl start docker" to start it.

It would help to tell what OS and docker version are you using.
